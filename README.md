# fjordbrowser
a new browser for the web. (chatgpt atlas without chatgpt bloat)

to use this, you will need to provide your own api key (gemini) for summarization.

**important: this is currently in the earliest possible stage of development, call it alpha, call it pre-alpha, call it pre-pre-alpha or whatever its not ready, alot of the features aren't even done yet, but i wanted to push it anyways. ill update it soon with more features, like doing stuff for you.**

thanks.
